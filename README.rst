Shelves and buckets is a small package for easier work with grouped data or data ranges. It originates from the need to easily find data in multidimensional space using intervals. Lets look at the following examples:

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://shelves-and-buckets.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

Interval shelves are using the intervals_ package

.. _intervals: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/intervals

 - IntIntervalShelf - interval boundaries are integers
 - FloatIntervalShelf - interval boundaries are floats
 - NamedShelf - takes a dictionary as input and behaves similarly but could be combined with other shelves


Examples
--------

Consider the following data for physical state based on number of pushups a person can make

    +------------+------+-----------+-----------+
    + Pushup     + <20  | 21 - 40   | 41+       +
    +============+======+===========+===========+
    + Grade      + Poor | Average   | Excellent +
    +------------+------+-----------+-----------+


How to find in which group the user belongs based on their score::

    >>> from shelves_and_buckets import IntIntervalShelf
    >>> shelf = IntIntervalShelf([
            ('(, 20]', 'poor'),
            ('[21, 40]', 'average'),
            ('[41, )', 'excellent'),
        ])
    >>> shelf.get(5)
    'poor'
    >>> shelf.get(25)
    'average

Ok, let's take a look at a bit more complicated example, what if we have another dimension e.g. the age of the person.

    +-------------+-----------+---------------+---------+
    + Age / Grade + excellent + above average + average +
    +=============+===========+===============+=========+
    +  20-29      +  > 54     +  45-54        +  35-44  +
    +-------------+-----------+---------------+---------+
    +  30-39      +  > 44     +  35-44        +  24-34  +
    +-------------+-----------+---------------+---------+
    +  40-49      +  > 39     +  30-39        +  20-29  +
    +-------------+-----------+---------------+---------+

Example::

    male_20_29_shelf = IntIntervalShelf([
        ('[35, 44]', 'average'),
        ('[45, 54]', 'above average'),
        ('(54, )', 'excellent'),
    ])

    male_30_39_shelf = IntIntervalShelf([
        ('[24, 34]', 'average'),
        ('[35, 44]', 'above average'),
        ('(44, )', 'excellent'),
    ])

    age_shelf = IntIntervalShelf([
        ('[20, 29]', male_20_29_shelf),
        ('[30, 39]', male_30_39_shelf),
    ])

    >>> age_shelf.get_multi(24, 42)  # value are passed from the outer shelves in, in this case -> age, pushups
    'average'


Shelves also support usage with indexing for adding and getting buckets::

    shelf = IntIntervalShelf()
    shelf[[0, 10]] = 'Bucket A'
    shelf[[11, 20]] = 'Bucket B'
    >>> shelf[5]
    'Bucket A'


Intervals are not allowed to overlap. In such cases and `IntervalsOverlap` exception is raised::

    from shelves_and_buckets import FloatIntervalShelf
    shelf = FloatIntervalShelf()
    shelf.add('[0, 2)', 'Bucket A')
    shelf.add('[1, 2)', 'Bucket B')
    >>> Traceback (most recent call last):
    >>>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    >>>   File ".../shelves_and_buckets.py", line 63, in add
    >>>     raise IntervalsOverlap('Interval {} overlaps interval {}'.format(interval, existing_interval))
    >>> shelves_and_buckets.exceptions.IntervalsOverlap: Interval [1.0, 2.0) overlaps interval [0.0, 2.0)


By default you are not allowed to have gaps between the intervals. In such case an `IntervalsDoesNotConnect` exception is raised::

    shelf = FloatIntervalShelf()
    shelf.add('[0, 2)', 'Bucket A')
    shelf.add('[3, 4]', 'Bucket B')
    >>> Traceback (most recent call last):
    >>>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    >>>   File ".../shelves_and_buckets.py", line 70, in add
    >>>     'Interval {} does not connect with interval {}'.format(interval, last_interval))
    >>> shelves_and_buckets.exceptions.IntervalsDoesNotConnect: Interval [3.0, 4.0] does not connect with interval [0.0, 2.0)


TODOs
-----

    - Add option to pass directly Interval object when creating bucket
    - Consider using bisect for faster search in intervals http://www.ilian.io/working-with-intervals-in-python/
